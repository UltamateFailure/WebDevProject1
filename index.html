Project: About Me
Name: Bryce Jordan
Submitted: 1/14/2025
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflect:  I really didn't like doing the table. I ran into a lot of issues trying to align
 the text and set the styles for each cell. I Wanted to change border color and a few other 
 things but it never worked how I wanted it to. I eventually gave up and did it tediusly. The repeat image was 
 hard to figure out and I couldn't figure out how to get the image to come from the file but I got the url working by 
 finding the image online and getting the url and putting that in. I also didn't know you could just do background-repeat 
 and not have to have x or y which made it really easy. I really liked changing the colors of the table cells 
 even if I struggled. It was cool to see what can be done with the built in table. I liked this project as I got to
 jump into html and get used to all its weirdness.

			<h2>My personal interests</h2>
			<p style="text-indent: 25px"> I spend way too much time playing games. My current favorite games are
				Helldivers, Warframe, Portal and Project Zomboid. This is the hobby I sink the most time and money into.
				I have a beefy rig that I am still upgrading. I am really excited for the new 50 series graphics card
				from Nividia. I am so excited for a game that was announced recently called The Blood of The Dawnbreaker
				from developers that I have been following for a while. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: 25px"> Another big interest I have is theology, the study of religion. I have started
				to get interested in this topic a few years ago after reading several texts. This opened me up to this
				amazing world of philosophy and deeper thought. Now I watch a lot of <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/@CosmicSkeptic" target="_blank">Alex O'Connor</a> who is a fast
				growing philosopher who hosts a show called <em>Within Reason</em> where Alex hosts a guest from many
				different schools of thought. This interest has helped me expand my own thought about life and death.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 25px">With winter upon us I have been so excited to go up on the slopes with just two
				planks of wood going over 50mph. I have skiied since I was 4 and have tried to go up every year since.
				Two years ago I got a bad concussion on Christmas and took a year break the next season. This season is
				my first season back since then. I just bought new skis, poles and boots. It was a blast to go up on the
				mountain again.</p>
